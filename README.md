# Cyclistic Case Study

This case study focuses on the descriptive analysis of real-world data from Motivate International Inc., a bicycle ride-share company. The data is publically available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data includes tabular information about individual bicycle trips, including starting and ending station, duration, type of bicycle used (classic or electric), and -- crucially -- whether the trip was taken by a subscription non-subscription ("casual") customer. It also includes tabular station data. Detailed descriptions of the data are included in the notebook ("cyclistic_case_study.Rmd").

The goals of the analysis were two-fold:
1. To determine systematic temporal and/or geographical differences in use patterns between subscription and non-subscription customers.
2. To identify non-subscription customers that would be susceptible to conversion.

The key result of this study was the construction of robust statistical use profiles for subscription and casual customers

I conducted the analysis using approximately 20 million records. It involved significant data cleaning and organization, which is thoroughly detailed in the notebook.

The entirety of the analysis was conducted in R. I chose R because it was a new language to me at the time; through this project, I gained substantial experience and comfort using R and RStudio.

This analysis was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification, but all aspects of the analysis and code are entirely my own.
